# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
DNA DUNGEON


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that takes a portions of DNA input by the user, and walks them through DNA replication using their strand. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our program will walk a user through DNA transcription and translation, otherwise known as the Central DOGMA. The goal is to teach an audience who knows nothing on the subject and explain it in very simple and easily understandable steps. The begining of the program explain the pupose of the central dogma and explain individual nucleotides. The user would then be prompted to input a 12 character DNA sequence using the nucleotides, and the process would begin. It would start with replication, then transcription, and finally translation using biopython. Each step would be explained using fun graphics and print statements. The end result would be a polypeptide chain, with four peptides coded for using RNA.  


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will take a strand of DNA and spit out base pairs, mRNA, amino acids/polypeptide chain

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding graphics that make the program more enjoyable and easily understood.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Some aspects of our program allows the user to interact with the graphics and maybe add a mini game or two. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our fisrt step is to further research and understand how to incorporate the DNA central dogma's steps into an easily-understood and fun, interactive program that encourages learning. We'll have to figure out how to implement Biopython, which may be easier than we expect, depending on how fast we learn how to use it. We'll probably use dictionaries when converting our DNA base pairs through the translation and transcription processes. For and while loops may also be needed. In addition to this, we'll have to prompt our user to continue through the mini lesson and explain along the way, using print("..."). We'll also have to learn how to create our graphics, which may require a second imported tool, other then Biopython. We could also try to utilize pygames if we're able to add minigames.
