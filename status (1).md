Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
We are doing a story mode based game that explains gene expression through the guise of escaping a dungeon. I have created a functional button class that allows me implement the next step of the story. (That was definetley the most challegeing part thus far). My partner has created 2 out of 3 minigames that will be embedded in the code. 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Connected all the pieces contributed by the partners. I also haven't completely finished the backbone of the game, with all screen displaying and explaining Gene Expression. We also plan to add music and scrolling credits to the game. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Sharing our work with each other. Neither of us are Computer Science majors, and I don't mean to speak for me partner, but I'm not that technologically inclined.
