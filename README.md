# DNA_Project-Final
 Brought to you by Isabella Rios, Sophmore (Environmental Science major, Information Sciences and Technology minor) and Quinn Fricko, Sophmore (Biology major - Pre-Dental, Information Sciences and Technology minor) Our project aims to tell the fantastical tale of gene expression through a story-mode game with interactive minigames and a unique DNA strand per gameplay. We incorporated pygames and biopython to help us implement ideas in biology in a fun and factual way. The player will be tasked with escaping a dungeon via completing small challenges that explain the process gene expression goes through in real life.

Getting Started:

1. Download biopython and pygames so everything runs smoothly
2. Run " pip install biopython " and " python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user " in the terminal to download the required software
3. Download the main game zip file and upload the file into VS Code to run and play ;)
4. Make sure to run the py file labeled " Main_Game_DD.py " to access the game

(Its a little longer than required, but we wanted to fit in the whole game)
